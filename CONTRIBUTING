# Contributing to Panther Assessment

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Panther Assessment! This tool helps faculty generate comprehensive assessment reports from Canvas LMS data.

## Scope

While developed at Florida Tech, Panther Assessment can work at any university using Canvas LMS. Contributions that improve functionality, fix bugs, or enhance documentation are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DarbyP/panther-assessment/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your operating system (Windows/Mac)
   - Canvas LMS version if relevant

### Suggesting Features
